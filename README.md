A RESTful Web Service with JAX-RS using the Jersey framework. This is a fully RESTful API (including HATEOAS), level 3 on the Richardson Maturity Model. The project is a similar idea to Facebook where there are messages, comments, profiles, and within relevant resources actions such as 'like' or 'share'. A client is able to consume the API to perform those actions and retrieve, edit, create, and delete desired resources.
